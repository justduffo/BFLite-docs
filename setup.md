## 🛠️ Requirements

> ℹ️ The framework is made using 5.4 if you have issues on lower versions make sure to reach out
- Unreal Engine 5.0 or higher  
- Windows (recommended)

BFLite is built using Blueprints only, so no C++ setup is required.

## 📦 Folder Structure (Brief Overview)

When your project opens, you’ll see organized folders for:

- `Blueprints/` – Main gameplay systems
- `UI/` – Menus and HUD elements
- `Sounds/` – Alle sounds used for the framework
- `Maps/` – Demo map + Menu 
- `Meshes/` - meshes that are included in the framework
- `Texture/materials/` used for the included meshes

We'll go over each system in more detail in the next sections.
